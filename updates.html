		    <h4>My One Year Coding Journey</h4>
			<h5><em>April 12, 2020</em></h5>
			<p>April 11, 2019 was my 'official' start date of learning coding, so I thought I'd do a little reflection and list some goals for the next year. I started coding on Khan Academy after logging back in for the first time in months. I had used it sporadically throughout that time, but hadn't logged in using my primary/original account. After looking around for a while, I saw the Computer Programming course, and the Hour of Code course. I remember having to do the Hour of Code back in 3rd grade (I think?), but I didn't really like it (it was a scratch-like version with blocks). I decided to try it out again on Khan. After finishing the Hour of Code for JS, I went on to start the Intro to JavaScript course.</p>
      <p>After finishing the Intro to JS course, I was pretty hooked. I went on to the Intro to HTML/CSS course, finished that, and then started the Intro to SQL course. After getting about halfway through the SQL course, I experienced some burn-out and decided to take a short break. Instead of completing it like I had planned, I created an account for Codecademy and practiced HTML and started learning Python. I think I learn a bit better over there, because I'm a visual learner. The audio on the lessons over on Khan is nice, but I can sometimes get distracted. I came back to Khan over the summer, and participated in a couple of coding activities. Over the winter, I went back and forth from Khan and Codecademy, and worked on the Advanced JS: Games and Visualizations course, the Advanced JS: Natural Simulations course, the Using JavaScript in webpages course, and Using JQuery in webpages course. I also continued learning Python and started learning Swift over on Codecademy. That's pretty much where I am today, but I've done some basic learning in a couple of other languages.</p>
      <p>I'm really grateful for the Khan Academy coding community, and everyone else who has helped me along the way. They've answered my questions (even when I'm pretty sure they've answered the same ones over and over again!), given me really helpful feedback, and inspired me to grow even more. I've found ways to give back, like answering questions myself and evaluating CS projects.</p>
      <p>Moving forward throughout my next year of coding, I hope to become more proficient in Python and SQL, continue learning Swift, and start learning more Java. I also want to find more opportunities to practice my skills in other languages, and learn more computer science.</p>
